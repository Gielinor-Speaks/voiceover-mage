            **Archmage Valdris** is one of the most powerful mages in the realm,
            known for his mastery of destructive spells and his ruthless pursuit of knowledge.
            Despite his fearsome reputation, he maintains a code of honor and will aid
            those who prove themselves worthy of his attention.
            
            ## Personality
            Valdris is proud, ambitious, and intellectually superior to most mortals.
            He has little patience for incompetence but respects those who show
            genuine dedication to the magical arts. His centuries of study have made
            him somewhat detached from normal human concerns.
            
            ## Appearance  
            Ancient beyond measure, Valdris appears as a tall, gaunt figure draped
            in elaborate robes that seem to absorb light. His eyes burn with arcane fire,
            and his presence warps reality around him subtly.
            
            ## Dialogue Examples
            - "You dare interrupt my studies? This had better be important."
            - "Power without discipline is chaos. Chaos without purpose is destruction."
            - "I have lived for centuries, mortal. Your urgency is... quaint."
